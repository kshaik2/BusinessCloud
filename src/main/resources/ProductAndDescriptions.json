						"text" : "<p>Expense Management automates all employee-based financial processes in a single, consolidated solution, and offers world-class reporting and auditing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Expense Management allows even complex, multinational organizations to automate expense-related business processes and enforce policy compliance, reducing associated administrative costs and decreasing the opportunity for accidental error and intentional fraud. With it, companies can implement instantaneous global updates to policies and processes to support continuous improvement, while simultaneously managing local policies and statutory requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The solution provides you with:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Expense Reports-Infor's web-based, automated system dramatically reduces the hassle, time, and cost of creating, approving, and processing expense reports, and offers the visibility and control necessary to comply with today's accounting standards. Travelers can create and manage expense reports whenever and wherever it's convenient-the office, the airport, even a taxicab-with Infor's offline client and mobility platform. Plus, reviewers can open expense reports and attached supporting documents when they receive email alerts-without logging into the application.</li>\r\n<li>Travel Plans-Travel Plans enforces corporate travel policy before spending occurs, because the system verifies compliance with corporate policy as employees make their travel plans-which they must then submit for approval. Plus, Travel Plans allows attachment of travel plans to expense reports to compare planned and actual expenses. Not only does this help managers make better approval decisions, it adds rich analytic capabilities to improve future budget planning.</li>\r\n<li>Payment Requests-Employees sometimes must purchase goods and services immediately, bypassing the company's purchase requisition and order process. As a result, these requests often go untracked, resulting in an incomplete view of employee spending. Payment Requests closes this gap by eliminating duplicate data entry and automating validation, ensuring that requests are accurate, complete, and charged to the correct cost centers or project codes. While Payment Requests is designed for use by non-finance employees, accounts payable (AP) and purchasing personnel can also use the system to enter information on behalf of other employees.</li>\r\n<li>Timesheets-Accurate recording of salaried and hourly employee time is vital for timely customer billing and payroll calculation. Yet, this simple function is typically manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Timesheets simplifies the process by letting employees accurately report project hours as well as general work and absence hours, in a fraction of the time required by traditional paper-based methods. Quicker processing times and fewer errors lead to more efficient customer billing cycles and a reduction in days sales outstanding, contributing directly to the bottom line.</li>\r\n<li>Mobile device support-Employees can create expense reports on smart phones and other mobile devices anywhere, any time. Plus, managers can view and approve expense reports from their mobile devices, leading to time savings, maximum performance, and rapid response.</li>\r\n<li>Digital receipt management-Employees can easily attach, email, or fax receipts for a paperless solution.</li>\r\n<li>Flexible, affordable delivery options-Choose from an unparalleled range of software deployment options. Take advantage of a hosted version and let us deal with application management, or license the application outright.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>All Expense Management modules:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alert employees to violations as they enter data, allowing them to provide explanations or make corrections before submitting plans or expenses.</li>\r\n<li>Alert reviewers, obtain necessary approvals, and then trigger events such as issuing plane tickets and reimbursing expenses.</li>\r\n<li>Analyze the solution's database, searching for opportunities to transform spending into savings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In addition, Expense Management:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Captures information for analysis and benchmarking, identifying spending patterns that can be used to negotiate savings with vendors.</li>\r\n<li>Supports multiple languages and currencies.</li>\r\n<li>Provides seamless integration for corporate card data.</li>\r\n<li>Works with all international date and currency formats.</li>\r\n<li>Facilitates application of rules and policies specific to independent divisions or geographic locations.</li>\r\n<li>Accommodates country-specific per diem rates, local taxation requirements, variable VAT rates, and mileage rates.</li>\r\n<li>Significantly reduces discretionary spending through compliance, visibility, third-party spending, and error reduction.</li>\r\n<li>Seamlessly integrates with other Infor systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>"

						"text" : "<p>ERP Express quickly converts customer requirements into manufacturing requirements and then executes them efficiently. Lean concepts eliminate redundant or wasteful steps that users may be forced to go through with other manufacturing software.</p>\r\n<p>True to its name, ERP Express provides a compelling visual presentation that shows how each part of the manufacturing process relates to the other parts-helping to resolve bottlenecks, schedule effectively, and price jobs accurately.</p>\r\n<p>For manufacturers, ERP Express supports mixed-mode production strategies, including engineer-to-order, make-to-order, assemble-to-order, and make-to-stock. ERP Express also displays all key statistics on a single screen, helping ensure that schedules are met, materials arrive on time, and costs are in line with estimates.</p>\r\n<p>Core modules include: </p>\r\n<ul class=\"bullets longContentList\"><li><strong>Manufacturing Window</strong>-Creates an engineering plan or bill of material (BOM) quickly and easily with a full-color, graphical interface, and then uses the design to automatically create a quote and/or work order. Provides a comprehensive view of the materials and operations involved in the engineering process, including both macro and micro views of your business. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Cost Accounting</strong>-Captures costs as changes occur, ensuring up-to-date and accurate costs. Lets you choose between actual costs and standard costs. Links purchases directly to existing work orders through the Purchasing or Manufacturing modules, earmarking costs that are specific to jobs. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Quoting and Estimating</strong>-Creates professional and comprehensive quotations, determines realistic delivery dates based on material and resource availability, and turns quotes into sales orders. Users can create quotes quickly and easily by copying them from another quote, an existing work order, or a BOM, and then modifying the new quote to match customer specifications. Plus, users can estimate costs for material, labor, burden, and outside services, and, once a contract is awarded, automatically create sales and work orders from quotes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Order Management</strong>-Manages a large volume of customer orders and meets varied fulfillment objectives. Helps users manage customer order allocation and new product deployment planning throughout the supply chain. Also optimizes fulfillment, reduces order processing cycle times, provides cost-effective sourcing of inventory to customer orders, and increases revenue through substitution, cross-selling, and value-added services.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Contact Center</strong>-Retains existing customers and acquires new accounts by tracking everything there is to know about prospects and customers. Schedules activities, assists in sending letters and emails, and keeps detailed notes about conversations with contacts. Provides histories, tasks, and other sales data for every contact, at every account. Accesses important back-office data such as accounts receivable, current part inventory, return material authorization (RMA) status, estimates, sales orders, credit status, and shipments for each customer. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Purchasing</strong>-Coordinates material purchases by providing online decision support that simplifies record keeping. Helps control inventory, enhance cash flow, and shorten delivery times. Handles all types of purchases, including inventoried items, supply items, outside service operations pertaining to a manufacturing order, and subcontracted items that require delivery of components to a vendor. Accommodates drop shipments at locations other than the primary ship-to address, such as warehouses or customer locations. Provides standard form reports such as purchase orders, acknowledgments, and order lists for purchasing personnel, as well as analytical accounts' payable-related reports-including purchase order lists and accrual reports. \r\n</li><li><strong>Concurrent Scheduling</strong>-Ensures the most efficient use of materials and resources, and provides the necessary information to deliver product on time, with two powerful tools-Global Scheduler and Scheduling Window. ERP Express was the first software system to feature concurrent scheduling, which considers both material and capacity constraints when generating shop schedules.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Material Requirements Planning (MRP)</strong>-Manages the balance between supply and demand, providing a comprehensive analysis of your material situation, including the suggested action to restore balance. Suggests when to release supply orders (for either purchased or fabricated parts) based on the most up-to-date supply and demand information available. Also helps reduce inventory, increase manufacturing productivity, and facilitate cash flow. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Master Production Scheduling (MPS)</strong>-Working with MRP, MPS translates business plans, including forecasted demand, into production plans using firm planned orders in a true multi-level, optional component scheduling environment. Drives the manufacturing process, and prevents shortages, costly expediting, last-minute rescheduling, and inefficient allocation of resources.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Shop Floor Control</strong>-Seamlessly integrates all ERP Express's features, including inventory control, material and labor tracking and reporting, purchasing, and scheduling. Provides complete control over production operations, eliminating redundant data entry and ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout the shop floor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Executive Information System</strong>-Allows decision makers to view and analyze key factors and performance trends in the areas of sales, purchasing, production, and finance, and to see both summary and detail-level data. Displays summarized data that reflects the overall status of the enterprise. Spotlights areas that need attention before situations become critical and costly by highlighting key performance indicators. Lets decision makers trace problem areas directly to the source.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Inventory Control</strong>-Provides greater accuracy and immediate access to inventory information throughout the company. Automates part-tracking by adjusting inventory whenever a part transaction occurs. Designates inventory items as purchased, manufactured, stocked, or non-stocked so you can immediately place a purchase order or issue a job order when you need a particular item. Tracks materials and costs on a per-project basis, providing an online, in-depth, time-phased, netting evaluation of the complete supply and demand situation for parts. Provides complete profiles of any part in the system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dimensional Inventory Tracking</strong>-Breaks down the total quantity of inventoried parts into various dimensional sizes, providing more control. Calculates the correct total order quantity by making necessary conversions when a specified number of pieces are issued by dimension. Immediately adjusts all values related to a part transaction, so you can purchase, receive, and enter a material requirement simply by entering the number of pieces of material, the required dimensions, and the warehouse location. Also performs a physical inventory of specified numbers of pieces and dimensions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Engineering Change Notice</strong>-Establishes controls and manages the process of making changes to documents and drawings, parts, BOMs and routings, work orders, and projects. \r\n</li><li><strong>Throughput</strong>-Measures productivity considering the contribution of a job or product toward company profit, calculated as price of goods sold minus cost to produce. Increases profit by working a schedule that will increase throughput, using measurements not commonly found in ERP and MES systems. Accesses a variety of reports and inquiries: actual or expected throughput reports; and utilization, contention, and material constraint inquiries. Displays \"what if\" scenarios to help determine whether a request is feasible. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Workflow</strong>-Passes information from one person or department to another through an automated process cycle, integrating policies and procedures with information flow according to predefined conditions or rules. Provides master, predefined, and user-defined workflow templates, ensuring a logical, repeatable flow of data. Releases defined workflows into the ERP Express system, where they operate behind the scenes. Notifies users of tasks and activities that require action. Routes information, such as customer orders, purchase orders, or engineering changes, to internal and external participants in the business process, incorporating approval functions along the way. Allows users to conveniently track and monitor the status of documents. \r\n</li><li><strong>Data Import Utility</strong>-Provides a BOM and part-import interface for 3PL applications, which must generate a properly formatted flat file. Validates all fields, recalculates required quantities, and produces a log of all transactions during the import process.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Messages</strong>-Transmits important information to appropriate persons, either within or outside the company, using familiar email features. Delivers alerts to user workstations, pagers, cellular phones, printers, and fax machines. Defines important events within the manufacturing process, creating and transmitting messages to key personnel. Allows employees to focus on other business without needing to constantly check in, while ensuring they'll be informed of-and can act on-critical information.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Management Reporting</strong>-Analyzes and manages enterprise and accounting data providing the methodology to build customized queries and forms, define business graphics, and create complex cross-tabular reports. Also helps pinpoint resource contention-otherwise known as bottlenecks-to improve shop floor schedules, increase on-time delivery, and improve profits. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Return Material Authorization</strong>-Manages documents that control the return of parts previously sold and shipped to a customer. Contains an ID status and other identification regarding who is returning the material, and for what purpose. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Lot and Serial Traceability</strong>-Creates trace records for each lot number, serial number, or other grouping of a part, and automatically tracks each part as it flows through your plant. Assigns additional information, including a description, expiration date, and other user-definable fields. Tracks parts from material receipt through product delivery, as well as all intermediate levels. Prompts operators for additional information when receiving and issuing material and reporting labor. Reviews flow of material lots and serialized parts as they move through the manufacturing process. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Quality control</strong>-Makes quality assurance an intrinsic part of your workflow. Establishes, tracks, and manages every engineering activity and supply chain expectation, while supporting business growth and profitability goals. Creates critical manufacturing specifications for products, processes, equipment, and measuring devices, and improves enterprise team collaboration with vendors, customers, and employees. Get tools to automate associated design, pre-production, production, and post-production activities; expertly manage business performance; and easily collect, control, and analyze quality system data.</li></ul>"

Consolidate your financials across your business, prepare budgets and track performance, support strategic planning and forecasting, and get access to deep analysis and insight into all areas of your business.</li>\r\n<li>Dynamic Enterprise Modeling (DEM) that lets you configure the system to match the way you run your business and the way your users use it.

						"text" : "<p>ERP Business is built with extensibility from the ground up. The ERP Business framework gives you the ability to adapt the system to your business, rather than requiring you to force your business to fit the software. The model in the ERP Business framework makes it possible to adapt the ERP Business application to new business requirements without incurring the high cost and delays involved in modifying or writing new code. This, in turn, allows you to rapidly adapt the system to your business, while continuing to receive new features and fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With ERP Business, you get:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mixed mode manufacturing.

An efficient method for managing the entire sales process, from customer lead origination and sales opportunity tracking through converting prospects to customers and placing the order. Tight integration between the front and back office streamlines sales and customer service processes, decreases the cost of sales and cost to serve, and ultimately increases revenue.</li>\r\n<li>Role-based information. All the information you need to do your job in a single screen. We have identified the specific daily tasks of specific career positions in our customers' organizations and defined the exact collection of information and actions that help them accomplish that job effectively. This collection is presented on a home page, the set of actions and data most closely associated with a specific, defined job in an organization, such as customer service, controller, or production planner. This helps you make faster, more efficient and informed decisions. </li>\r\n<li>Better user experiences. Easily customize the user interface to fit a particular industry, team, or an individual user. Add, remove, and edit fields, labels, and complete screens without having to call on IT for help. Get the information you need, when you need it, with easy-to-use grid forms. Plus, reduce or eliminate costly modifications to personalized features with upgrades to the system.</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft-based system. Familiar tools and common navigation translate to big time savings on implementation, customization, and training. Plus, ERP Business interfaces with Microsoft Project; the ERP Business calendar and task list tightly integrate with Outlook; and SharePoint pages can include charts and lists that display current ERP Business data.</li>\r\n<li>Flexible deployment options. Subscribe to ERP Business through the Infor cloud computing platform to multiply the performance-enhancing and cost-cutting benefits. Go back and forth between the on-premises and cloud-based versions any time-or combine the two.

CPM Planning, Budgeting and Forecasting draws on the information you have across your organization and around the world at the level of detail you require. </p>\r\n<p>It helps companies improve every aspect of the planning, budgeting, and forecasting process, including:</p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Budgeting more effectively</strong>-Document the budgeting process, educate system users across the organization, monitor company-wide budget submissions and approvals from anywhere at any time, and enforce budget rules and timelines. The central communication portal, guided workflow capabilities, electronic budget submission and approval process, and automated exception alerts are just some of the tools that will help you gain control over this process.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Planning more effectively</strong>-Model your business quickly and test multiple scenarios easily, so you can prepare realistic financial and operational plans that help your organization achieve its goals. Driver-based modeling helps your company define its business success factors, key contributors to those factors, and then plan them in detail providing a roadmap to improved performance. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Testing \"what if\" scenarios</strong>-Comprehensively model your business and perform real-time \"what if\" scenario planning. You can change a business assumption, and watch as the software automatically recalculates the entire model for you, freeing you to concentrate on the actual plan instead of the math. With this solution, you can build in calculations, allocations, phasing, market factors, seasonality, and more.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ensuring realistic results with forecasting</strong>-Let the calculation engine select the optimum method for data analysis, and create benchmarks to test the likely accuracy of employee-submitted forecasts, ultimately reducing forecast game-playing. You can also use this objective forecast to jump-start your planning and budgeting process. Forecasting lets you predict not only at a summary level, but also at a detailed level, such as product line, region, or sales channel.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Adjusting actions to achieve goals</strong>-Shift planning away from less accurate historical budgeting and forecasting, and move toward continuous predictive modeling and rolling forecast models-automatically adjusting the revenue targets to meet your goals as each period closes and a new period rolls forward.<br></li></ul>\r\n<p>CPM Planning, Budgeting and Forecasting delivers unique value to customers by:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Leveraging familiar spreadsheet tools to improve forecasting.</li>\r\n<li>Delivering sophisticated analytical tools that don't require statistical expertise.</li>\r\n<li>Improving your ability to create complex models and generate accurate forecasts.</li>\r\n<li>Accelerating the process of planning and budgeting.</li></ul>"
